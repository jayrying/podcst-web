Podcst Web is a modern PWA to listen to podcasts.

The aim of this project is to provide an excellent podcast listening experience,
on all types of devices (desktop, tablets, mobile).

Another major focus is on accessibility, the app is and should be accessible to the visually impaired, and allow 100% keyboard navigation.

> **Note:** This project only aims to support ever-green browsers.

## Architecture

This project uses the [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) branching model.
See the [development](#development) section below for additional details.

- [master](https://github.com/shantanuraj/podcst-web/tree/master) is the production branch
- [develop](https://github.com/shantanuraj/podcst-web/tree/develop) is the active branch where commits are made

### Prerequisites

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/)   - node version 8+ for using latest ES2016+ featuers
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)  - package manager

### Getting the Source Code

Once the prerequisites are installed on your system, you can clone this repository with `git` and install the code dependencies using `yarn`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shantanuraj/podcst-web
yarn
```

## Development

The following steps are for building and installing from the source code. First compile the code to the `build` folder in the project directory.

```bash
# build:dev compiles to unoptimised dev friendly build
yarn build:dev

# build:prod and build:staging compile to optimised / minified production ready build
yarn build:prod
```

or to compile in watch mode (automatically compile on file change)

```bash
yarn dev
```

Once the url reported by the webpack-dev-server

> **Note:** Code changes are hot-reloaded but *not* perfectly components render multiple times. You must click the `Reload (âŒ˜R)` if you face any issues.

## Building

When you first clone this repository, you'll need to initialize gitflow by running: `git flow init -d` in the project root folder.

Now that your local environment is all setup, you can use the following procedure to contribute to this project.

  1. Run `git flow feature start <feature-name>`
  1. Implement your feature and commit the changes.
  1. Run `git flow feature finish <feature-name>`

Use the following process to cut a new release.

  1. run `git flow release start <semver>`
  1. bump the `package.json` version.
  1. commit the changes.
  1. run `git flow release finish <semver>`
  1. run `git push --follow-tags`

You'll find a great [tutorial on gitflow here](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/) if you want to learn more about the details of how it works.
